I'm an experienced Data Engineer, leading MLOps standardization at The HEINEKEN Company.

Developing with e.g. Airflow, AWS, Azure, Databricks, Docker, Kubernetes, Neo4j, Python, Scala and Spark. Graduated from Delft University of Technology.

Additionally, I'm a board member of a homeless shelter. Earlier I worked for RTL Netherlands, Jan Kees de Jager, among other valuable experiences.
